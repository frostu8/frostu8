I Freaking Love Rust! :crab:

## Contact
You may, of course, contact me through the email on my GitHub profile <theguy@frostu8.rs>.
The commit email I use, <frostu8@protonmail.com> is for attribution purposes only, really.
You *can* reach me there, but I recommend contacting me on the former email since the
latter has **heavy** filtering applied on it. TL;DR I may not see your email if you send
to my protonmail email.

Wanna contact me some other way? I am updating my methods constantly on my website @
<https://frostu8.rs/contact/>.
