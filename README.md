I reinvent the wheel a lot.

I like :crab: **Rust**, :droplet: **Elixir** and :regional_indicator_g: **Go**. 
I think everything should be built in those languages. Composition over 
inheritance. Functional programming best programming.

I hate **PHP**. If you are a PHP developer, I'm watching you with intense, yet 
docile aggrivation.

"Rust is taking over the world, *my life*. It has applications for everything,
and if it wasn't for the browser, Rust would monopolize the programming world.
But, with the implementation of
[WASM Interface Types](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/08/webassembly-interface-types/),
everything will come to a stop. Python, C#, and PHP developers alike will have
to stop and kneel to the Rustaceans, or risk their life defying the new
world order. That time is soon, and with every Mozilla business day, it draws
nearer." - frostu8, sometime ago
